# Dispatcher

Go API + React Router SPA, shipped as a single binary.

- `main.go` — wiring: env, database, routes, server.
- `handlers.go` — `/api/*` handlers.
- `db.go` — GORM models and connection.
- `spa.go` — serves the built frontend (embedded via `go:embed`), with an `index.html` fallback for client-side routes.
- `web/` — React Router v7 app in SPA mode (Vite is its build tool; it outputs static files to `web/build/client`).

## Development

Two terminals:

```sh
make dev-api   # Go API on http://localhost:8090
make dev-web   # frontend on http://localhost:5173, proxies /api to the Go server
```

Work against http://localhost:5173 — you get Vite HMR, and API calls hit Go.

## Production

```sh
make build     # npm run build, then go build (frontend embedded)
./dispatcher   # serves everything on :8090 (override with PORT)
```

Note: `go build` embeds `web/build/client`, so the frontend must be built first — `make build` handles the order.

## Database

GORM with DuckDB (via `github.com/vogo/duckdb/v2`). Data lives in `dispatcher.duckdb` next to the binary (override with `DB_PATH`); `db.go` holds the models and connection, and `AutoMigrate` runs on startup. Building needs CGO (DuckDB links a C library) — already the Go default.

## Notifications

Notification targets send payout requests, template health drops, and weekly template summaries to Discord, Slack, ntfy, or a custom HTTP webhook. Targets use editable Go text/templates and can be tested before they are enabled.

Background collection, auto-withdraw, weekly summaries, and notification delivery assume the app runs as a single process. Running multiple replicas can duplicate cron work and notifications.

## CLI

`dispatcherctl` is a small, standalone HTTP client intended for agents and
scripts. It queries a running Dispatcher instance, never its DuckDB file or
Railway directly. Authenticated commands use the same Railway OAuth flow and
session as the browser app; there are no separate API tokens. The health check
remains public just like `/api/health`.

Build or install the CLI, point it at the instance, and log in:

```sh
make build-cli
# Or: make install-cli

export DISPATCHER_URL="https://dispatcher.example.com"

./dispatcherctl login       # opens Railway OAuth in your browser
./dispatcherctl whoami

./dispatcherctl summary
./dispatcherctl templates
./dispatcherctl payouts --days 90
./dispatcherctl notifications
./dispatcherctl withdraw-settings
./dispatcherctl withdraw-accounts
```

During login Dispatcher creates a short-lived pending login and returns a
Railway authorization URL. The CLI opens that URL (or prints it in a headless
environment) and polls Dispatcher while the browser completes the existing
OAuth callback. The result is bound to a verifier held only by the CLI, so the
browser never receives the Railway session itself. This also works when the CLI
and browser are on different machines. Sessions are stored with owner-only
permissions in the operating system's user config directory. Use
`dispatcherctl logout` to remove the session for an instance.

Responses are JSON and are pretty-printed by default. Pass `--compact` before
the command for machine-friendly JSONL output. `get` makes it possible to query
new read endpoints without waiting for a CLI release:

```sh
./dispatcherctl --compact get analytics/templates
```

Run `dispatcherctl help` for the full command list. A remote Dispatcher URL must
use HTTPS for login; plain HTTP is accepted only for loopback development. Set
`DISPATCHER_CONFIG` or pass `--config` to override the credentials-file path.

To stamp a release version into the binary:

```sh
make build-cli CLI_VERSION=v0.1.0
./dispatcherctl version
```

## Adding things

- **API route**: register another `mux.HandleFunc("GET /api/...")` in `main.go`, implement it in `handlers.go`.
- **Model**: add a struct in `db.go` and list it in `AutoMigrate`.
- **Page**: add a file under `web/src/routes/` and register it in `web/src/routes.ts`.
